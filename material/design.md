### Full Story: Immigrant-owned Businesses on the Rise

William Hall | [Fox/MSNBC] News

A recent report released using U.S. Census Bureau data states that immigrant-owned businesses employed over 8 million workers in fiscal year 2017, up from 2016 totals. These businesses also saw a rise in the total number of sales over the year, increasing to almost $1.3 trillion.

These statistics are born out of hundreds of success stories across many different sectors of the economy, especially the service industry.

Eduardo Rodriguez, a 62 year old immigrant living in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago, is a perfect example of this success. The Little Village community has had its economic struggles, with an unemployment rate of 13 percent and an annual median income of $30,000 -- less than half of the national average. These conditions have not stopped Rodriguez, however.  He currently owns and operates four Dulcelandia stores in Little Village, which are packed with over 1,000 types of delicious candies from his home country of Mexico.

After immigrating here in 1966, Rodriguez opened up the store and it became an instant gathering spot in the neighborhood. "People seem to really like what we are doing, and I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to do this in the United States. It takes a lot of work and sacrifice -- we're fulfilling a niche market that people really want to buy from."

Following in her father's footsteps, Rodriguez's daughter, Eve Rodriguez Montoya, has also opened up a handful of shops which specialize in healthy frozen yogurts with some Mexican-inspired flavors.

"Our community is very strong and hard-working -- resilient and resourceful," she said. "I'd say come to our community, get to know our people. Shop at our locations and see for yourself -- Little Village is full of people who came to this country to achieve the American Dream."

![Percent of Immigrant Entrepreneurs](fig/immig_entrepreneurs.png){width=45%}

The Rodriguez's story is just one of many: as more immigrants look to open their own businesses, and employ more workers, many markets, both broad and niche, will continue to expand, providing more fuel to an already strong economy.
