# Treatment Group Vignette

This information will be migrated from the file Jason was working on.

# Control Group Vignette

**Issue 1:** We are not certain that there is a need for a separate (neutral) vignette for the control group. See the following image for our understanding of the design:

![design](fig/design_tree.jpg)

Everything above the red line is the control group as we have thought of it before; however, we contend that the red line is the *actual* representation of the control group's progression through the survey experiment. 

Since we have decided on a single story (i.e. number 3 from Jason's list) we only have a positive treatment. Before we thought there would be two frames-- one positive and one negative. Now, we just have one actual frame.

TLDR; manipulations for the control group are not actually relevant when there is only a positive treatment. 

**Issue 2:** Should our "solution" to issue 1 not be convincing to the group, here are some alternative frames for the control group.

2. Airbag Safety - lives saved 
- Headline: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that over 50,457 people are alive today because of their airbags since 1987.  In 2017, the use of seat belts in passenger vehicles saved an estimated 14,955 lives of occupants 5 and older.

    SY: Safety issue would be considered as non-political yet relevant to large population across the nation which could be equivalent to immigration issue.

3. Internal Migration Statistics 
- Headline: Each year, roughly 40 million Americans, or about 14 percentÂ of the U.S. population, move at least once. Much of that movement includes younger people relocating within cities, but it is trends of Americans moving to warmer climates, more affordable areas, and better job opportunities that have largely determined migration patterns in recent decades.

    SY: Internal migration is not relevant to immigration or other political issue. However, considering the impact of migration can affect your neighboring environment, job market, etc.
