# Study Design & Questionnaire

*Notes*:

- Only edit this file as `.md`, not `.docx`.
- I used the material from Hopkins 2019 as an initial template for the survey questions, make sure to cite him in this context.
- I just started collecting potential items, selection and ordering is by no means final.
- Think about how the study will be advertised on MTurk: e.g., "Study on Online News and Political Attitudes" (add full description)

### Full Story: Immigrant Entrepreneur Numbers on the Rise

> Immigrant-owned businesses employed almost 8 million American workers
William Hall | Fox News

A recent report released from the U.S. Census Bureau states that immigrant owned businesses employed over 8 million workers in fiscal year 2017, up from the 2016 total of X. This sector of the economy also saw a rise in the total number of sales over the year, increasing to almost $1.3 trillion in 2017.

These statistics form into hundreds of success stories across many different sectors of the economy, especially the service industry.

Eduardo Rodriguez, a 66 year old immigrant living in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago, is a perfect example of this success. Rodriguez owns four Dulcelandia stores, which are packed with over 1,000 types of delicious candies from his home country of Mexico.

After immigrating here in 1966, Rodriguez opened up the store and it became an instant gathering spot in the neighborhood. "People seem to really like what we are doing, and I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to do this in the United States. It takes a lot of work and sacrifice."

> "We're fulfilling a niche market that people really wanted to buy from"

Following in her father's footsteps, Rodriguez's daughter, Eve Rodriguez Montoya, has also opened up a handful of shops which specialize in healthy frozen yogurts with some Mexican-inspired flavors.

"Our community is very strong and hard-working — resilient and resourceful," she said. "I'd say come to our community, get to know our people. Shop at our locations and see for yourself —Little Village is full of people who came to this country to achieve the American Dream."

The Rodriguez's story is just one of many: as more immigrants look to open their own businesses, and employ more workers, many markets, both broad and niche, will continue to expand, providing more fuel to the many different sectors of the economy.
