# Questionnaire - Draft

*Notes*:

- Only edit this file as `.md`, not `.docx`.
- I used the material from Hopkins 2019 as an initial template for the survey questions, make sure to cite him in this context.

## Survey Flow Overview

- Pre-treatment measures:
  - Media usage
  - General ideology
  - Basic immigration attitudes
  - Perception of migrants' contribution to economy
  - Optional: Racial resentment and similar scales
- Experiment:
  - First treatment: tweet (search/assigned X source X pro/con X RT ratio)
  - First outcome: click on link or click on next?
  - Second treatment: full article
  - Remaining outcome measures: perception, attitudes, etc. (within-subject?)
- Post-treatment measures:
  - Sociodemographics etc. (beware of post-treatment bias!)
