  Various pressing issues at the center of today's politics--such as immigration, climate change, or the recent coronavirus pandemic--are imbued with misinformation. A growing body of research therefore explores the potential impact of providing corrective information. However, while such interventions appear to reduce people's factual misperceptions, they have little to no effect on their underlying attitudes. This study examines how the impact of corrective information on beliefs and attitudes is moderated by media choice. In our survey experiment, participants are asked to read a news article published by Fox News or MSNBC, each highlighting the positive economic impact of legal immigration in the United States. While the news content is held constant across sources, our treatment manipulates whether participants are allowed to freely choose a media outlet or are randomly assigned to one of them. Our results illustrate how people's media choice moderates the effectiveness of corrective information: While factual misperceptions are easily corrected regardless of how people gained access to the information, subsequent opinion change is conditional on people's prior willingness to seek out alternative sources. As such, encouraging people to broaden their media diet may be more effective to combat misinformation than disseminating fact-checks alone.

Citizens in western democracies hold wide-ranging and systematic misperceptions about immigrants to their home countries. For example, people usually overestimate the total number of immigrants or the proportion of immigrants that are dependent on social welfare [e.g., @alesina2019immigration]. Given this extensive spread of misinformation, various studies examined how corrective information may affect people's underlying attitudes towards immigration, albeit with limited success. Although corrective information may alleviate factual misperceptions, it rarely affects people's underlying attitudes [see for example @hopkins2019muted].

A possible explanation for this apparent disconnect could be that factual information is simply irrelevant for attitude formation and---if anything---serves as a mere justification for people to rationalize their existing predispositions towards immigrant populations. However, the extent to which people engage such motivated reasoning is not without limits---as people have been shown to update their prior beliefs after reaching a "tipping point" of counter-attitudinal information [@redlawsk2010affective]. Furthermore, recent research on immigration attitudes demonstrate the persuasiveness of certain interventions such as canvassing [@kalla2020reducing].

Why do researchers frequently fail to find evidence of attitude change after providing respondents with corrective information? We argue that most experimental designs in this area are inconclusive because they omit a crucial mechanism: people's discretion over whether to engage with a given information source or not. Specifically, studies usually employ simple random assignment of informational treatments without considering people's selective exposure. Unfortunately, such a set-up does not allow us to estimate the quantity of interest that is ultimately of key interest: the effect of misinformation corrections among *people who would have chosen to access the information in the first place* [see also @benedictis2019persuading; @knox2019design].

We address these shortcomings of previous research by implementing an experimental design that varies both, the source of misinformation corrections as well as the process through which people access the information. Specifically, we conduct an online survey experiment on the effectiveness of corrective information about immigration. Depending on the experimental condition, participants are either able to freely choose--or are assigned to--an article published by different news channels (Fox News vs. MSNBC), which discusses the economic impact of legal immigration. Crucially, our design allows us to differentiate how the information treatment impacts factual beliefs, how they are interpreted, as well as broader attitudes towards immigration. The results indicate that while the correction of factual misperceptions is does not depend on media choice, subsequent attitude change is conditional on people's willingness to seek out alternative sources.

Taking into account endogenous information search in studies of misinformation corrections is crucial in our rapidly changing media environment where people have unprecedented control over their information diets [see also @iyengar2009red]. While people can access an ever-growing set of news outlets of varying quality, we only have a limited understanding how these systemic changes in information channels moderate the effectiveness of corrective information itself. Past research mostly focused on the effect of different _types_ of misinformation corrections. This study contributes to the literature by shifting the focus to the question of _how_ and _from where_ corrective information reaches people.


# Why misinformation corrections (often) fail

To the extent that people rely on inaccurate factual beliefs to form their opinions, misinformation can severely impede democratic representation by inducing collective preferences that systematically diverge from a more informed public [@kuklinski2000misinformation]. For instance, earlier studies focusing on aggregate opinion estimated that increasing individual information levels results in altered preferences of the electorate [e.g., @bartels1996uninformed; @althaus1998information]. Experimental studies examining change in individual attitudes, however, only found scant evidence for information treatments impacting peoples underlying opinions [see @flynn2017nature for an overview].

Focusing on misinformation in the context of immigration, @hopkins2019muted conducted multiple survey experiments informing participants about the size of the foreign-born population in the US---a statistic that is systematically overestimated by people in the absence of corrective information. In other words, many Americans are systematically misinformed, and this misinformation is associated with attitudes towards minority groups. Across seven separate survey experiments, the authors find that "accurate information does little to affect attitudes toward immigration, even though it does reduce the perceived size of the foreign-born population. [...] Misperceptions about the size of minority groups may be a consequence, rather than a cause, of attitudes toward those groups" [@hopkins2019muted, 315]. The authors therefore suggest that attitudes towards immigration resist change because they are grounded in more fundamental predispositions that are independent of the factual premise [see also @hainmueller2014public]. 

In sum, changing people's minds by providing corrective information is far from easy---especially when it comes to deeply held beliefs that are connected to people's identities [@nyhan2019taking]. However, this does not imply that new facts are bound to have no attitudinal consequences whatsoever. Although people engage in motivated reasoning and resist counter-attitudinal evidence [@Taber2006], there is some evidence that they are not completely immune to it [@redlawsk2010affective]. Before turning our discussion to a potential mechanism that may facilitate such attitude change, we need to begin by developing a clear conceptualization of different types of updating that may result from exposure to corrective information.


## Differentiating factual beliefs, interpretations, and opinions

First, we define factual *beliefs* as assessments of the state of the world that are (at least in principle) intersubjectively observable and can therefore be either true or false. Using the study by @hopkins2019muted as an illustrative example, the statement "12 out of every 100 people living in the United States are immigrants who were born outside of the U.S." describes a factual belief that is objectively verifiable and--importantly--completely void of evaluative components. As mentioned above, it turns out that people are systematically misinformed about the size of the foreign-born population in the sense that they consistently overestimate this statistics. Corrective information in this example simply consists of providing the accurate value of this statistic and @hopkins2019muted show that such an intervention is effective in reducing (factual) misperceptions.



Corrective information targets the misinformation itself!

Even though people update their factual beliefs as conditions change, individuals can interpret the same factual beliefs differently depending on characteristics such as their partisanship. Many times interpretations, rather than factual beliefs drive opinions [@gaines2007same]. 

Interpretations afford leeway to align factual beliefs with undeniable reality and continue to justify partisan preferences.

Why don't people update their related attitudes? One explanation is that they first have to be interpreted either by individuals themselves or by letting others do it for them [@gaines2007same].

1. **Complete Updating:** \hspace{0.5em} reality $\rightarrow$ beliefs $\rightarrow$ interpretations $\rightarrow$ opinions
2. **Fact Avoidance:** \hspace{2.4em} reality **| |** beliefs $\rightarrow$ interpretations $\rightarrow$ opinions
3. **Meaning Avoidance:** \hspace{0.4em} reality $\rightarrow$ beliefs **| |** interpretations $\rightarrow$ opinions
4. **Opinion Avoidance:** \hspace{0.85em} reality $\rightarrow$ beliefs $\rightarrow$ interpretations **| |** opinions

Changing beliefs is the most trivial aspect. What is more interesting, and ultimatelz more important when thinking about the issue of democratic representation is whether these changes in beliefs ultimately result in changing interpretations and/or opinions. Unfortunately, the we know very little about the underlying mechanisms that drive these aspects.

News reports contain interpretations, and these interpretations are more dependent on source credibility.

## The role of media choice, source credibility, and selective exposure

Mass media is by far the most regular used information source. @dalton1998partisan found that perception of news is shaped as much by a person's political views as by objective content. Even if an individual perceives their news source as unbiased, they will perceive their daily news source to report biased information. They found that regardless of the paper's actual stance it was viewed as skewed toward the opposite political beliefs of the reader. Individuals with strong partisan beliefs are more skeptical that "neutral" media reports with accuracy and believe the media as biased against their beliefs [@little2019distortion].

Sources that are deemed credible are more influential than sources with low credibility. Credibility includes both expertise and trustworthiness and studies have found that source credibility impacts whether individuals will correct misinformation [@guillory2013correcting]. One would assume that non-partisan authorities would be a trusted source of information. However, in a time when partisanship colors how people perceive new information, even neutral sources might be less credible than is often presumed [see @berinsky2018telling]. Neutral sources such as the AMA and the AARP lack authority at time because they are overridden by politicized ones. It is rare for Republicans and Democrats to find a independent source therefore many sources of information lack credibly. This partisan lens extends to how individuals process fake news. Error correction of fake news is mostly likely to be effective when coming from a co-partisan w/ whom one might expect to agree [@berinsky2017rumors].

The idea of source credibility extends to the individual political actor. @kuklinski1994hearing connected the use of ideological heuristics and source cues. They argued that by focusing their attention on the individual political actor, citizens make quick judgments of the information presented to them based largely on the reputation of the speaker. Experimental subjects presented with a message evaluated that message based largely on their opinion of the speaker. In this way the messenger overwhelms the message.

Source credibility profoundly affects social interpretations of information
[@lupia1998democratic].
<!-- [I don't have access to this book, need to check to see if anyone has notes] -->

<!-- Two lines of potential reasoning (discussed in 5/1/19 meeting): The first is a methodological argument. From this perspective, we can argue that including the endogenous search manipulation is cleaner from a design perspective. This way, we have the comparison between randomly allocating and letting you choose vs. giving friendly or not friendly source. This is important because giving someone a friendly vs. unfriendly source cue depends on how good your measurement is (whether a or b is friendly). We can make an argument that we can get at that measurement and get a prediction but it’s based on an assumption. In reality, there might be diffs in how people select or reveal what they trust. As soon as these potential errors are taken into account, it is compelling to make an arg that its cleaner than trying to find out what’s friendly or unfriendly and then assigning. Ultimately it’s a pure design question. -->

<!-- But is it theoretically something different? Is choosing substantively diff than mech of friendly vs unfriendly source. Is it about control over choosing itself? Big mech is whether you trust info source or not. If it’s the same, need to rethink whether our contribution to the literature is going beyond what the source cue lit has done.  -->

<!-- Ultimately, this manipulation allows us to study how people react to information—most give random info and look at effects. Big diff in info environment is that you choose info you’re exposed to—think about contribution in terms of looking at whether information choice changes effect of information you’re given. Fake news literature? Assumption that as soon they are given info by anyone they are suspicious of it?  -->

<!-- Here, we explore an alternative explanation for the lack of evidence that corrective information shifts people's attitudes. Specifically, despite a large exisiting body of literature on the importance of source cues [e.g., @goren2009source; @ladd2010role], prior studies on misinformation corrections rarely consider the potential role of source credibility. -->


## Hypotheses

1. Misinformation corrections have stronger effects on people's factual **beliefs** than their related **interpretations** or **opinions**.
2. Misinformation corrections have stronger effects if people are able to **choose** their information source. These differences are more pronounced for opinions and interpretations than for beliefs.
3. Misinformation corrections have stronger effects if the information source is **consistent** with people's media preferences. These differences are more pronounced for opinions and interpretations than for beliefs.

<!-- H1: Fact avoidance is rare, but meaning avoidance and opinion avoidance is more common. -->
<!-- H2: Classic source cue argument: Meaning avoidance and opinion avoidance is less common if people are exposed to news organizations they prefer -->
<!-- H3: Meaning avoidance and opinion avoidance is less common if people have discretion over what information to access -->

**Empirical Questions:**

- Does the ability to **choose** always imply **consistent** exposure?
- If choice $\neq$ consistency, how do their effects differ?


# Research Design

Previous research examining the effectiveness of corrective information showed that it does not always lead to attitude change even if misperceptions are reduced [@hopkins2019muted; @thompson2019might]. However, others find that media exposure can persuade people to change their attitudes under certain conditions [e.g., @benedictis2019persuading]. Our study explores how the way people access corrective information influences the likelihood of its success in reducing misperceptions. In general, we expect that those who were able to choose a news agency are more likely to pick a source similar to their usual media diet. Additionally, we expect those who read a news story from a trusted news source (and who are able to pick the news agency) are more inclined to evaluate the article positively and change their attitudes in the direction of the news article.

## Overview

Our study builds on the Preference-Incorporating Choice and Assignment Design proposed by @benedictis2019persuading and @knox2019design. Participants are randomly assigned to a free choice treatment condition, a forced exposure treatment condition, or a control group. Participants in the free choice condition are asked to choose whether they want to see a recent breaking news tweet from either FoxNews or MSNBC. After viewing the tweet, which links to a news story focusing on immigrant-owned businesses in the US, participants are asked to read the corresponding article. In the forced exposure condition, participants do not have the option to choose a news organization (FoxNews or MSNBC), but are randomly assigned to one or the other. In either condition, the content of the news article is held constant across sources. By holding the content constant, our design has the additional advantage of more clearly differenting the effects of the choice vs assigned group by ensuring that the differences are not a result of the structure, content, or tone of different stories. Finally, participants who are randomly assigned to the control group skip the tweet and article entirely and move directly from the pre-treatment battery (questions on media usage, stereotyping, and political attitudes/behavior) to the post-treatment battery (questions on attitudes toward immigrantion and trust in different media sources). For more details on the design, see Figure 1 below as well as the full questionnaire, including all treatment conditions, in our pre-registered analysis on EGAP.
