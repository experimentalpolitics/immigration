  Various pressing issues at the center of today's politics--such as immigration, climate change, or the recent coronavirus pandemic--are imbued with misinformation. A growing body of research therefore explores the potential impact of providing corrective information. However, while such interventions appear to reduce people's factual misperceptions, they have little to no effect on their underlying attitudes. This study examines how the impact of corrective information on beliefs and attitudes is moderated by media choice. In our survey experiment, participants are asked to read a news article published by Fox News or MSNBC, each highlighting the positive economic impact of legal immigration in the United States. While the news content is held constant across sources, our treatment manipulates whether participants are allowed to freely choose a media outlet or are randomly assigned to one of them. Our results illustrate how people's media choice moderates the effectiveness of corrective information: While factual misperceptions are easily corrected regardless of how people gained access to the information, subsequent opinion change is conditional on people's prior willingness to seek out alternative sources. As such, encouraging people to broaden their media diet may be more effective to combat misinformation than disseminating fact-checks alone.

# Introduction

Citizens in western democracies hold wide-ranging and systematic misperceptions about immigrants to their home countries. For example, people usually overestimate the total number of immigrants or the proportion of immigrants that are dependent on social welfare [e.g., @alesina2019immigration]. Given this extensive spread of misinformation, various studies examined how corrective information may affect people's underlying attitudes towards immigration, albeit with limited success. Although corrective information may alleviate factual misperceptions, it rarely affects people's underlying attitudes [see for example @hopkins2019muted].

A possible explanation for this apparent disconnect could be that factual information is simply irrelevant for attitude formation and---if anything---serves as a mere justification for people to rationalize their existing predispositions towards immigrant populations. However, the extent to which people engage such motivated reasoning is not without limits---as people have been shown to update their prior beliefs after reaching a "tipping point" of counter-attitudinal information [@redlawsk2010affective]. Furthermore, recent research on immigration attitudes demonstrate the persuasiveness of certain interventions such as canvassing [@kalla2020reducing].

Why do researchers frequently fail to find evidence of attitude change after providing respondents with corrective information? We argue that most experimental designs in this area are inconclusive because they omit a crucial mechanism: people's discretion over whether to engage with a given information source or not. Specifically, studies usually employ simple random assignment of informational treatments without considering people's selective exposure. Unfortunately, such a set-up does not allow us to estimate the quantity of interest that is ultimately of key interest: the effect of misinformation corrections among *people who would have chosen to access the information in the first place* [see also @benedictis2019persuading; @knox2019design].

We address these shortcomings of previous research by implementing an experimental design that varies both, the source of misinformation corrections as well as the process through which people access the information. Specifically, we conduct an online survey experiment on the effectiveness of corrective information about immigration. Depending on the experimental condition, participants are either able to freely choose--or are assigned to--an article published by different news channels (Fox News vs. MSNBC), which discusses the economic impact of legal immigration. Crucially, our design allows us to differentiate how the information treatment impacts factual beliefs, how they are interpreted, as well as broader attitudes towards immigration. The results indicate that while the correction of factual misperceptions is does not depend on media choice, subsequent attitude change is conditional on people's willingness to seek out alternative sources.

Taking into account endogenous information search in studies of misinformation corrections is crucial in our rapidly changing media environment where people have unprecedented control over their information diets. While people can access an ever-growing set of news outlets of varying quality, we only have a limited understanding how these systemic changes in information channels moderate the effectiveness of corrective information itself. Past research mostly focused on the effect of different _types_ of misinformation corrections. This study contributes to the literature by shifting the focus to the question of _how_ and _from where_ corrective information reaches people.


# Why misinformation corrections (often) fail

In principle, providing people with new information should have the potential to change their attitudes related to the underlying issue. Yet, numerous studies have shown that changing people's minds is far from easy---especially when it comes to deeply held beliefs that are connected to people's identity. How individuals respond to a new set of facts and evidence depends on their motivation to arrive at an accurate conclusion as well as people's assessment of the information source as credible and relevant. Absent substantial motivation to accurately process information, individuals interpret new information in light of their extant attitudes. A compelling explanation of this pattern is the tendency to engage in motivated reasoning. In short, humans are biased information seekers [@kunda1990case; @Taber2006] and asymmetric updaters [@sunstein2016people]. Nevertheless, given the right conditions, people have been shown to update their beliefs in light of new evidence [@redlawsk2010affective]. In order to understand when misinformation corrections can be effective and why they might fail, it is important to start with a clear conceptualization of the underlying mechanism involving opinion change.


## Differentiating factual beliefs, interpretations, and opinions

People form different interpretations from the same facts. This seems to have increased recently. The facts, or objective information, surrounding climate change, impeachment, and COVID-19 are interpreted differently. As people interpreted these facts opinions were formed that informed attitudes. Attitudes are a set of emotions, beliefs, behaviors towards an object, person or event. How a person interprets the facts of COVID-19 interpreted their behavior as the event unfolded.

Factual beliefs become relevant for political judgments only when people interpret them.
Even though people update their factual beliefs as conditions change, individuals can interpret the same factual beliefs differently depending on characteristics such as their partisanship. Many times interpretations, rather than factual beliefs drive opinions [@gaines2007same]. Interpretations give opportunity to rationalize existing opinions and attitudes. Rationalizations include evaluations such as the number casualties is modest loss, or number of immigrations is high or low. Another form of rationalizations are explanations. An example of this is the explanation that there were no weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq because they never existed. Lastly, inferences such as spending on war can mean domestic needs are ignored. Another rationalization could lead to questions such as an immigration tradeoff or redistribution.
Interpretations afford leeway to align factual beliefs with undeniable reality and continue to justify partisan preferences. As events unfold, onslaught of evidence-ex. Figures recited on daily news-can trump partisan motivation with respect to factual beliefs. Motivation colors judgement, but people are also motivated to be rational [@kunda1990case].

A substantial body of research indicates that factual belief and knowledge is reliably associated with ideologically constrained attitude. The underlying assumption is that individuals will develop ideologically organize their attitudes toward specific political issue if they have acquired enough information for forming the conceptual content of the left-right continuum. Therefore, a person who possesses more well-developed political schemas, or well-organized pieces of political information is more likely has clear issue stances/attitudes [@zaller1992nature; @stimson2015tides]. 
Evaluative Motivation [@federico2007expertise] suggests that the critical process relates to the need to use factual beliefs for evaluative purposes. In this vein, the use of ideology actually consists of two different processes: first, factual belief provides individuals an understanding of the left-right continuum, enabling them to meaningfully identify themselves with an ideological position Secondly, resulting ideological predispositions can then be used for evaluative judgment about a broader set of political issue.

Can correct information change attitudes? Correct information can change factual beliefs or perceptions but not necessarily related attitudes [@hopkins2019muted]. Do facts influence attitudes? Jury is out, but probably not [e.g., @hopkins2019muted]. Whether people update and what it means to update is up for debate. 

Why don't people update their related attitudes? One explanation is that they first have to be interpreted either by individuals themselves or by letting others do it for them [@gaines2007same]. "People cannot turn to a manual to determine if an additional 50 troop casual-ties during the past month represents a big, moderate, or small loss."

## The role of media choice, source credibility, and selective exposure

Mass media is by far the most regular used information source. @dalton1998partisan found that perception of news is shaped as much by a person's political views as by objective content. Even if an individual perceives their news source as unbiased, they will perceive their daily news source to report biased information. They found that regardless of the paper's actual stance it was viewed as skewed toward the opposite political beliefs of the reader. Individuals with strong partisan beliefs are more skeptical that "neutral" media reports with accuracy and believe the media as biased against their beliefs [@little2019distortion].

Sources that are deemed credible are more influential than sources with low credibility. Credibility includes both expertise and trustworthiness and studies have found that source credibility impacts whether individuals will correct misinformation [@guillory2013correcting]. One would assume that non-partisan authorities would be a trusted source of information. However, in a time when partisanship colors how people perceive new information, even neutral sources might be less credible than is often presumed [see @berinsky2018telling]. Neutral sources such as the AMA and the AARP lack authority at time because they are overridden by politicized ones. It is rare for Republicans and Democrats to find a independent source therefore many sources of information lack credibly. This partisan lens extends to how individuals process fake news. Error correction of fake news is mostly likely to be effective when coming from a co-partisan w/ whom one might expect to agree [@berinsky2017rumors].

The idea of source credibility extends to the individual political actor. @kuklinski1994hearing connected the use of ideological heuristics and source cues. They argued that by focusing their attention on the individual political actor, citizens make quick judgments of the information presented to them based largely on the reputation of the speaker. Experimental subjects presented with a message evaluated that message based largely on their opinion of the speaker. In this way the messenger overwhelms the message.

Source credibility profoundly affects social interpretations of information

<!-- [I don't have access to this book, need to check to see if anyone has notes] -->

<!-- Two lines of potential reasoning (discussed in 5/1/19 meeting): The first is a methodological argument. From this perspective, we can argue that including the endogenous search manipulation is cleaner from a design perspective. This way, we have the comparison between randomly allocating and letting you choose vs. giving friendly or not friendly source. This is important because giving someone a friendly vs. unfriendly source cue depends on how good your measurement is (whether a or b is friendly). We can make an argument that we can get at that measurement and get a prediction but it’s based on an assumption. In reality, there might be diffs in how people select or reveal what they trust. As soon as these potential errors are taken into account, it is compelling to make an arg that its cleaner than trying to find out what’s friendly or unfriendly and then assigning. Ultimately it’s a pure design question. -->

<!-- But is it theoretically something different? Is choosing substantively diff than mech of friendly vs unfriendly source. Is it about control over choosing itself? Big mech is whether you trust info source or not. If it’s the same, need to rethink whether our contribution to the literature is going beyond what the source cue lit has done.  -->

<!-- Ultimately, this manipulation allows us to study how people react to information—most give random info and look at effects. Big diff in info environment is that you choose info you’re exposed to—think about contribution in terms of looking at whether information choice changes effect of information you’re given. Fake news literature? Assumption that as soon they are given info by anyone they are suspicious of it?  -->

<!-- Here, we explore an alternative explanation for the lack of evidence that corrective information shifts people's attitudes. Specifically, despite a large exisiting body of literature on the importance of source cues [e.g., @goren2009source; @ladd2010role], prior studies on misinformation corrections rarely consider the potential role of source credibility. -->


## Hypotheses

1. Misinformation corrections have stronger effects on people's factual **beliefs** than their related **interpretations** or **opinions**.
2. Misinformation corrections have stronger effects if the information source is **consistent** with people's media preferences. These differences are more pronounced for opinions and interpretations than for beliefs.
3. Misinformation corrections have stronger effects if people are able to **choose** their information source. These differences are more pronounced for opinions and interpretations than for beliefs.

<!-- H1: Fact avoidance is rare, but meaning avoidance and opinion avoidance is more common. -->
<!-- H2: Classic source cue argument: Meaning avoidance and opinion avoidance is less common if people are exposed to news organizations they prefer -->
<!-- H3: Meaning avoidance and opinion avoidance is less common if people have discretion over what information to access -->

**Empirical Questions:**

- Does the ability to **choose** always imply **consistent** exposure?
- If choice $\neq$ consistency, how do their effects differ?


# Research Design

Previous research examining the effectiveness of corrective information showed that it does not always lead to attitude change even if misperceptions are reduced [@hopkins2019muted; @thompson2019might]. However, others find that media exposure can persuade people to change their attitudes under certain conditions [e.g., @benedictis2019persuading]. Our study explores how the way people access corrective information influences the likelihood of its success in reducing misperceptions. In general, we expect that those who were able to choose a news agency are more likely to pick a source similar to their usual media diet. Additionally, we expect those who read a news story from a trusted news source (and who are able to pick the news agency) are more inclined to evaluate the article positively and change their attitudes in the direction of the news article.

## Overview

Our study builds on the Preference-Incorporating Choice and Assignment Design proposed by @benedictis2019persuading and @knox2019design. Participants are randomly assigned to a free choice treatment condition, a forced exposure treatment condition, or a control group. Participants in the free choice condition are asked to choose whether they want to see a recent breaking news tweet from either FoxNews or MSNBC. After viewing the tweet, which links to a news story focusing on immigrant-owned businesses in the US, participants are asked to read the corresponding article. In the forced exposure condition, participants do not have the option to choose a news organization (FoxNews or MSNBC), but are randomly assigned to one or the other. In either condition, the content of the news article is held constant across sources. By holding the content constant, our design has the additional advantage of more clearly differenting the effects of the choice vs assigned group by ensuring that the differences are not a result of the structure, content, or tone of different stories. Finally, participants who are randomly assigned to the control group skip the tweet and article entirely and move directly from the pre-treatment battery (questions on media usage, stereotyping, and political attitudes/behavior) to the post-treatment battery (questions on attitudes toward immigrantion and trust in different media sources). For more details on the design, see Figure 1 below as well as the full questionnaire, including all treatment conditions, in our pre-registered analysis on EGAP.

## Measuring Belief, Interpretation, and Opinion


| Belief | Interpretation | Opinion |    
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Across the United States, how many workers--immigrant and US-born--do you think are employed by immigrant-owned businesses? | On average, would you say that people who come to live here from other countries will take jobs away from people already here or add to the economy by creating additional jobs? | Do you think the number of immigrants from foreign countries who are permitted to come to the United States to live should be [increased/left the same/decreased] |
| Taking your best guess, what was the total amount of sales revenue of immigrant-owned businesses in the last year? | Most people who come to live in the U.S. work and pay taxes. They also use health and social services. On balance, do you think people who come here take out more than they put in or put in more than they take out? | |
