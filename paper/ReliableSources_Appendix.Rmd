## Article Evaluation Conditional on Source and Media Preference

We asked participants to evaluate the news article on various dimensions such as "accurate vs. inaccurate" or "good vs. bad" (see Appendix D.I for question wording). Figure \ref{fig:article_eval} displays these average evaluations conditional on the respondents' media preferences and whether the source was Fox or MSNBC. The response patterns suggest that participants viewed the article more favorably if it was published by their preferred news network. We interpret this finding as evidence that they viewed the source attribution as believable. In other words, the fact that media preferences (and presumably differences in perceived source credibility etc.) result in diverging evaluations of the same content suggests that attributing the article to MSNBC or Fox News was a credible signal. This conclusion is further corroborated by the comparison of Average Choice-Specific Treatment Effects discussed in Appendix B.I.

# Additional Analyses

## Average Choice-Specifc Treatment Effects (ACTEs)

In addition to the analyses reported in the main text, we explore average choice-specific treatment effects (ACTEs) following @knox2019design and @benedictis2019persuading. In the context of our design, the ACTE describes the average effects of reading the article from Fox News instead of MSNBC among those who would usually prefer to read Fox News, MSNBC, or neither. A negative coefficient indicates that the expected value of the respective outcome measure is smaller among participants who were assigned to Fox News than among participants who were assigned to MSNBC. As such, the results in Figure \ref{fig:m4} suggest that people who usually prefer MSNBC evaluated the Fox News article less positively and were less likely to share it with others than the MSNBC article---despite the fact that the content itself was held constant across news outlets.

## Classification Accuracy based on Open-Ended Responses

The last analysis in the main text uses the well-established LIWC dictionary [@tausczik2010psychological; @pennebaker2015development] to examine differences in tentative language in two open-ended responses where participants explain their previous assessment of the immigrant community's contribution to society by creating jobs and paying taxes. The goal was to investigate whether the observed opinion change in response to voluntary exposure to inconsistent sources could be explained by the fact that people who decide to access inconsistent sources have more ambivalent immigration attitudes prior to receiving the treatment. Our analysis in the main text suggests that this is unlikely to be the case since there are no significant differences in tentative language between the forced exposure and free choice treatments (conditional on exposure to an inconsistent source).

Here, we replicate an equivalent null result using an alternative approach. Instead of relying on a predefined dictionary, we build on the methodology proposed by @Peterson2018classification and use the predictive accuracy of machine learning classifiers as a measure of "tentative" language. Specifically, we train a Naive Bayes classifier that predicts whether participants report pro- or anti-immigrant closed-ended attitudes based on their open-ended responses explaining their respective answer. The underlying reasoning is that it should be harder for the classifier to predict people's responses if they have ambivalent attitudes since they use tentative language and hedging instead of clear pro/con statements.

Our training set consists of all open-ended responses of participants in the control condition as well as those who were exposed to a consistent media source (or reported no clear preference for Fox News or MSNBC). Accordingly, the test set consists of all remaining open-ended responses of participants who were exposed to a source that was inconsistent with their media preferences (about 12% of the sample). We chose this particular split of training and test set in order to maximize the performance of our classifier and since we are ultimately only interested in evaluating the out-of-sample classification accuracy among respondents who were exposed to inconsistent sources.

The results of this comparison between voluntary and involuntary exposure to inconsistent sources are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:m6}. Higher predictive accuracy implies more concrete language and therefore less ambivalent attitudes. While the overall out-of-sample performance of the classifier is high (i.e., we are able to predict closed-ended attitudes based on open-ended responses), we find no evidence for increased ambivalence among participants in the free choice condition who accessed inconsistent sources voluntarily as compared to those who were forced to do so.

**Full Story: Immigrant-owned Businesses on the Rise**

William Hall | [Fox News/MSNBC]

A recent report released using U.S. Census Bureau data states that immigrant-owned businesses employed over 8 million workers in fiscal year 2019, up from 2018 totals. These businesses also experienced an increase in the total amount of sales revenue, which rose to almost $1.3 trillion during the same period.

These statistics are borne out of hundreds of success stories across many different sectors of the economy, especially the service industry.

![Percent of Immigrant Entrepreneurs](../material/fig/immig_entrepreneurs.png){width=45%}

Eduardo Rodriguez, a 62 year old immigrant living in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago, is a perfect example of this success. In an area of the city that has an unemployment rate of 13 percent and an annual median income of $30,000--less than half of the national average--the Little Village community faces considerable economic challenges. However, these conditions have not stopped Rodriguez.  He currently owns and operates four Dulcelandia stores in Little Village, each one packed with over 1,000 types of delicious candies from his home country of Mexico.

After immigrating here in 1966, Rodriguez opened his first store and it became an instant gathering spot in the neighborhood. "People seem to really like what we are doing, and I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to do this in the United States. It takes a lot of work and sacrifice -- we're fulfilling a niche market that people really want to buy from."

Following in her father's footsteps, Rodriguez's daughter, Eve Rodriguez Montoya, has also opened up a handful of shops that specialize in healthy frozen yogurts with some Mexican-inspired flavors.

"Our community is very strong and hard-working -- resilient and resourceful," she said. "I'd say come to our community, get to know our people. Shop at our locations and see for yourself -- Little Village is full of people who came to this country to achieve the American Dream."

The Rodriguez's story is just one of many. As more immigrants look to open their own businesses and employ more workers, many markets, both broad and niche, will continue to expand and provide more fuel to an already strong economy.

# Pre-Analysis Plan / De-identified Preregistration

## General Information about the Project

**Summary:** This document describes the planned analyses for an online survey experiment on the effectiveness of corrective information on misperceptions about the economic impact of legal immigration. As part of the experiment, participants are asked to answer questions about their use of different media sources, political leanings, and attitudes toward current issues covered in the news. Depending on the experimental condition, participants are asked to freely choose, or are assigned to, an article published by different news channels (Fox News vs. MSNBC), which discusses the economic impact of legal immigration. After reading the article, participants are asked to evaluate the news story and answer general questions about their attitudes towards immigration.

**Background and explanation of rationale:** Various important issues at the center of today's politics---such as immigration or climate change---are imbued with citizens' misperceptions. A growing body of research therefore explores whether such misperceptions can be mitigated by providing corrective information. While such corrections have been shown to reduce factual misperceptions, they appear to have little to no effect on underlying attitudes. Our study contributes to this active research area by examining how variations in the source and delivery mode of corrective information moderate their effectiveness. In our experimental design, respondents are exposed to a news article about immigration reported by either Fox News or MSNBC. The main treatment consists of either allowing free choice of the respective media source or assigning it randomly. Our outcomes of interest focus on the perceived economic impact of legal immigration, attitudes towards immigrants, and engagement with the news article. In order to isolate the effect of delivery mode and messenger, the news content is held constant across news sources.

**What are the hypotheses to be tested/quantities of interest to be estimated?** Our study explores how the way people access corrective information influences the likelihood of its success in reducing misperceptions. In general, we expect that those who were able to choose a news agency are more likely to pick a source similar to their usual media diet. Additionally, we expect those who read a news story from a trusted news source (and who are able to pick the news agency) are more inclined to evaluate the article positively and change their attitudes in the direction of the news article.

**How will these hypotheses be tested?** To test our hypotheses, we will rely on simple differences-in-means and OLS estimators.

**Ethics:** This study has been granted exempt status by \censor{the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's} Institutional Review Board (IRB No. \censor{20.044}) and has been granted approval to waive documentation of informed consent. All participants could stop participation at any time in the study and were debriefed at the end.

**Sample:** This study will be conducted using a sample of 600 participants recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk. It will be advertised as a survey on "Media Usage and News Consumption," where participants are asked to answer a short survey about their personal media diet and issues currently discussed in the news. The approximate length of the survey is 30 minutes and the reward will be $2. MTurk workers are required to have a 90% approval rate and have to be located in the United States in order to be eligible to participate. In line with current best practices, we are going to identify and screen out bots [see @kennedy2020shape].

**Experimental design:** Our study builds on the Preference-Incorporating Choice and Assignment Design proposed by @benedictis2019persuading and @knox2019design. Participants are randomly assigned to a free choice treatment condition, a forced exposure treatment condition, or a control group. Participants in the free choice condition are asked to choose whether they want to see a recent breaking news tweet from either FoxNews or MSNBC. After viewing the tweet, which links to a news story focusing on immigrant-owned businesses in the US, participants are asked to read the corresponding article. In the forced exposure condition, participants do not have the option to choose a news organization (FoxNews or MSNBC) but are randomly assigned to one or the other. In either condition, the content of the news article is held constant across sources. Finally, participants who are randomly assigned to the control group skip the tweet and article entirely and move directly from the pretreatment battery (questions on media usage, stereotyping, and political attitudes/behavior) to the post-treatment battery (questions on attitudes toward immigration and trust in different media sources).


## Outcome Measures

We consider several outcome measures to capture immigration attitudes and how the news story is received by participants. This section briefly describes each outcome and outlines relevant items in the questionnaire. Unless otherwise specified, outcomes that are measured using multiple variables will be combined in an additive scale. We are going to ensure that all items load properly on a single factor and exclude those that do not. Furthermore, we will report results using individual items in the appendix.

**Economic impact of immigration:** Our first outcome of interest captures the perceived economic impact of legal immigration. The news article includes specific information about the number of people in the US who are employed by immigrant-owned businesses as well as the total amount of sales revenue of immigrant-owned businesses. As part of the survey, participants are asked two questions covering these issues and our goal is to examine whether the news article is sufficient to correct related factual misperceptions (i.e., increase the proportion of correct responses on two questions covering this information). Two additional questions (analyzed separately) capture respondents' beliefs about how much immigrants contribute to society by paying taxes and creating jobs. Here, the outcome of interest is whether participants think that on balance, legal immigration has a more positive impact rather than creating a financial burden for society as a whole.

**Attitudes towards immigration:** Our second outcome measure focuses on people's attitudes towards legal immigration. Specifically, we ask participants whether they think that the number of immigrants in the US should be increased or decreased. This item allows us to assess whether the news article not only corrects factual misperceptions but additionally induces attitude change.

**Trust in news sources:** As an additional check, we also include a battery of items measuring trust in different news sources including FoxNews and MSNBC. Since the content of the news article is held constant between both news organizations, we can examine how exposure to an atypical news story (in this case published by FoxNews) impacts people's perception of the source itself.

In addition to these main variables, we evaluate four additional outcomes and conduct a simple manipulation check. Note that by the nature of the experimental design, these items can only be measured in the two treatment arms of the experiment and are not included in the control group.

**Engagement with tweet:** As described above, the tweet shown to participants consists of a link to a news article. While the link itself is not active and participants are never explicitly asked to click on it, we can examine whether participants nevertheless try to access the article. Whether they attempt to do so is used as an unobtrusive measure of the degree to which participants are interested in further engaging with the content voluntarily.

**Response latencies:** In order to further assess the extent to which respondents are interested in the article and comply with the instructions to read it carefully, we also measure the amount of time that individuals spend viewing the tweet and reading the news story.

**Sharing the article:** After reading the article, participants are asked to report their willingness to share it on social media, discuss it with friends, or whether they would be likely to seek out more information regarding the topic of the tweet and story.

**Evaluation of the article:** Our final outcome measure consists of a basic evaluation of the article, asking participants to disclose if they found the article fair or unfair, hostile or friendly, bad or good, skewed or balanced, American or un-American, and accurate or inaccurate.

**Manipulation Check:** In order to assess whether the tweet and news article were actually read by participants, we include a brief manipulation check. Specifically, respondents are asked which news organization published the story and what topic was covered by it.


## Hypotheses

Previous research examining the effectiveness of corrective information showed that it does not always lead to attitude change even if misperceptions are reduced [@hopkins2019muted; @swire2020they]. However, others find that media exposure can persuade people to change their attitudes under certain conditions [e.g., @benedictis2019persuading]. Our study explores how the way people access corrective information influences the likelihood of its success in reducing misperceptions. In general, we expect that those who were able to choose a news agency are more likely to pick a source similar to their usual media diet. Additionally, we expect those who read a news story from a trusted news source (and who are able to pick the news agency) are more inclined to evaluate the article positively and change their attitudes in the direction of the news article.

**Main analysis:** For the main outcome measures described above (i.e., immigration attitudes and perceived economic impact), our analysis begins with two basic comparisons between each treatment group and the control group:

- **H1a** [control vs. forced exposure]: Participants who are assigned to a random news organization update their beliefs and attitudes in the direction of the article .
- **H1b** [control vs. free choice]: Participants who are free to choose a news organization update their beliefs and attitudes in the direction of the article.

In the context of the outcomes described previously, updating beliefs and attitudes in the direction of the article refers to a decrease in factual misperceptions about the economic impact of legal immigration and more positive attitudes towards legal immigration more generally. Of course, our main interest is to assess whether corrective information is more effective if people are allowed to choose their preferred information source than if they are assigned to one. We, therefore, hypothesize that the free choice condition leads to a stronger attitude/belief change than the forced exposure condition:

- **H1c** [forced exposure vs. free choice]: Participants who are given the opportunity to choose a news organization are more likely to update their beliefs and attitudes in the direction of the article than participants who are randomly assigned to a news organization.

Note that this last comparison (*H1c*) can also be evaluated using the additional outcome measures described above (trust in news sources, engagement with tweet, response latencies, sharing the article, evaluation of the article), which are not included in the control group. For each of these outcomes, we expect that the ability to choose their preferred information source will increase engagement with the article and therefore lead to more positive evaluations. Here, we also plan to explore conditional treatment effects based on pretreatment measures of people's political predispositions (stereotypes towards immigrants, whether immigration is seen as a major issue, ideology, partisanship) and we will further examine whether the differences in *H1c* are conditional on participants being exposed to a news source that is congruent with their usual media diet. Any difference between the forced exposure and free choice condition could theoretically be driven either by the fact that participants in the free choice condition tend to select news organizations they are more sympathetic towards, or by the fact alone that they are able to choose a source (i.e., the selection process itself makes the information more effective). In order to distinguish both possibilities, we will conduct an additional test where we isolate the effect of forced exposure vs. free choice while holding the underlying news organization constant. Specifically, we are planning to compare both conditions within groups of individuals who were exposed to a congruent as compared to an incongruent source (either by choice or by random assignment). Additional analyses outlined below will allow us to further assess how endogeneous media exposure impacts the effectiveness of corrective information.

**Determinants of media choice:** Beyond this main analysis comparing the free choice and forced exposure conditions, we are going to confirm whether respondents indeed choose information sources that are consistent with their ideological predisposition and usual media diet. This part of the analysis therefore only focuses on the free choice arm of the experiment. Participants are expected to engage in a biased search process, seeking out information that is likely to support their preconceptions and avoiding evidence that undercuts their beliefs [see @Taber2006]. This leads to the following set of hypotheses regarding endogenous information search:

- **H2a:** When free to choose a news organization, conservatives (liberals) are more likely to pick FoxNews (MSNBC) than vice versa.
- **H2b:** When free to choose a news organization, Republicans (Democrats) are more likely to pick FoxNews (MSNBC) than vice versa.
- **H2c:** When free to choose a news organization, participants who report viewing FoxNews (MSNBC) more regularly are more likely to pick FoxNews (MSNBC).

**Effects of corrective information conditional on preferred media choice:** Lastly, we plan to examine whether there are systematic differences in the effectiveness of corrective information by news sources themselves (i.e., FoxNews vs. MSNBC). The pretreatment section of the questionnaire includes items on respondents' usual media diet and political predispositions. Respondents should be more inclined to update their attitudes and beliefs if the article is published by a news organization that is usually consistent with their priors:

- **H3a:** Conservatives (liberals) update their beliefs and attitudes more if they are randomly assigned to FoxNews (MSNBC).
- **H3b:** Republicans (Democrats) update their beliefs and attitudes more if they are randomly assigned to FoxNews (MSNBC).
- **H3c**: Participants who were randomly assigned to a news organization that is part of their regular media diet update their beliefs more than those who were assigned to a different news organization.

As a first step, these comparisons exclude the free choice arm of the experiment and estimate treatment effects based on the randomly assigned news organizations alone. Additionally, we are going to explore the average choice-specific treatment effect (ACTE) following @knox2019design to quantify the effect of corrective information conditional on endogeneous media search (*H3c*). This quantity of interest captures the conditional average treatment effect for the subset of participants who would choose a particular treatment option (i.e., the effect of the article among those who would have chosen FoxNews or MSNBC voluntarily).


## Estimation Strategy

**Statistical significance:** Throughout this study, we will use two-sided tests with an $\alpha$-value of 0.05 as the cutoff for statistical significance. In our graphical displays we will additionally plot 90% intervals to signal statistical significance at $p<0.10$.

**Missing data:** Respondents who report "don't know" on the outcome measures (if applicable) or who skipped the question will be treated as missing and excluded from the respective analysis (basic listwise deletion). While we are going to use the manipulation checks to evaluate whether respondents read the information provided to them, we decided not to drop respondents who failed to pass the manipulation checks in the subsequent analyses [see for example @aronow2019note].

**Main analyses:** To test our hypotheses, we will rely on simple differences-in-means and OLS estimators to compare the outcome measures between each treatment and the control group, respectively. The main analyses will focus on the average treatment effects relative to the control as well as the difference between both treatment conditions themselves. The power analysis reported below shows that given our sample size of 600, we have 85% power to detect a 0.3 standard deviation effect between the treatment and control group. However, we can only detect a 0.2 standard deviation effect between both treatment conditions with 53% power. We will also consider heterogeneous treatment effects by pretreatment covariates (stereotypes towards immigrants, whether immigration is seen as a major issue, and basic political predispositions) and we will explore average choice-specific treatment effects (ACTE) following @knox2019design. Unfortunately, our power analysis below suggests that our sample size is too small to reliably detect these conditional treatment effects.
