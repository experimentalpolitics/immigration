## 1. Introduction
* Check list
- [x] Project Summary and Aims
- [x] Rationale and Background

This document describes the pre-analysis plan for an online survey on media usage and news consumption regarding political issues. The survey seeks to learn about media viewing habits of individuals, especially on social media platforms, and how this impacts their political attitudes. In this survey experiment, participants will answer questions about their use of different media sources, political leanings, and attitudes toward current issues covered in the news. Depending on the experimental condition, participants will be asked to choose, or be assigned to, an article published by different news channels (Fox News vs. MSNBC), which discusses the economic impact of legal immigration. After reading the article, participants are asked to evaluate the news story and answer general questions about their attitudes towards immigration.  
There is a growing literature in political science on the role social media in fostering misperceptions about important political issues. Focusing on immigration, recent studies (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2019) found that providing corrective information can mitigate misperceptions among citizens. However, these corrections have little to no effects on underlying attitudes. Our study contributes to this active research area by examining differential effects of corrective information from different media sources by employing a modified Preference-Incorporating Choice and Assignment Design (De Benedictis-Kessner et al. 2019).  

## 2. Research Design
### Hypotheses
* Check list  
- [X] All Hypotheses which will be tested.  

The survey experiment is designed based on existing researches on corrective information and attitude change. Many researchers have shown that correcting misinformation does not always lead to attitude change (Hopkins er al. 2019; Swire-Thompson et al. 2019) while others shown that media can persuade people to change their attitudes under under certain conditions (e.g. De Benedictis-Kessner et al. 2019). 

To examine the differential effects of corrective information on attitude change, we need to look at two different process of adopting new information: information seeking and interpreting process. 

Selective exposure to information via different media sources may lead individuals to engage in a biased search process, seeking out information that supports their preconceptions and avoiding evidence that undercuts their beliefs (see Taber and Lodge 2006). This leads our first set of hypothesis on endogenous information search and its effectiveness.

_H 1: When free to choose what information they will expose themselves to, people will seek out confirming over disconfirming arguments. _

_H2: Allowing people to choose their preferred information source makes corrective information more effective._

[Lit reviews on preferred info source and persuasion]

In allowing for an endogenous information search in our survey design, we can manipulate the information search process. Not only do we expect that people seek confirming information, but those allowed to seek information will be more likely to update beliefs than those assigned corrective information. 

However, what if individuals expose random information? How individuals treat facts and other types of information depends on their motivation and ability to interpret (Lodge and Taber 2006). Without substantial motivation to accurately process information, individuals ay interpret new information through the prism of their extant attitudes. 

_H3: Those who receive information from ‘friendly’ sources are more likely to update beliefs._ 

[Lit review on the effect of cues/heuristics on interpreting information]

We expect that citizens are more likely to alter their attitudes when the source is perceived as sympathetic to ideological predispositions.

### Treatment Effects and Measurement
* Check list  
- [ ] Main variables of interest, precise definitions
- [ ] How outcomes will be measured
- [ ] Distinction between primary and secondary outcomes

[note]
- **Basic design:** 3-arm (choice/assigned + control)
	- _Treatment (choice/assigned):_ Before being able to view their contents, participants are either asked to choose between a Fox News or MSNBC tweet, or they are randomly assigned to one of them. In any case, the content of the tweet is held constant. After reading the tweet, participants are asked to read the full article linked in the tweet.
	- _Control condition:_ skip tweet & full story
	
- **Outcome measures:**
	- Do participants try to click on the tweet? (i.e., multiple clicks)
	- How much time do participants spend viewing the tweet?
	- How much time do participants spend on the full article?
	- Basic comprehension / attention check.
	- Attitudes towards immigration (see post-treatment section).
	- Trust in news sources (see post-treatment section).
