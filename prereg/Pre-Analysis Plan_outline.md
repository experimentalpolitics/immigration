## 1. Introduction
* Check list
- [x] Project Summary and Aims
- [x] Rationale and Background

This document describes the pre-analysis plan for an online survey on media usage and news consumption regarding political issues. The survey seeks to learn about media viewing habits of individuals, especially on social media platforms, and how this impacts their political attitudes. In this survey experiment, participants will answer questions about their use of different media sources, political leanings, and attitudes toward current issues covered in the news. Depending on the experimental condition, participants will be asked to choose (or be assigned to) an article published by different news channels (Fox News vs. MSNBC), which discusses the economic impact of legal immigration. After reading the article, participants are asked to evaluate the news story and answer general questions about their attitudes towards immigration.  
  There is a growing literature in political science on the role social media in fostering misperceptions about important political issues. Focusing on immigration, recent studies (e.g., Hopkins et al. 2019) found that providing corrective information can mitigate misperceptions among citizens. However, these corrections have little to no effects on underlying attitudes. Our study contributes to this active research area by examining differential effects of corrective information from different media sources by employing a modified Preference-Incorporating Choice and Assignment Design (De Benedictis-Kessner et al. 2019).
